Carmageddon 1/2 Development tools for 3ds max

![Cartmatools Buttons](http://www.harmsollie.nl/files/Carmatools/Carmatools_Buttons.png)

The Carmatools pack will enable you to develop cars and tracks for carmageddon 2 and export and import models for carmageddon 2 and 1.

These scripts are a result of many iterations of my original maxscripts for importing and exporting carmageddon models to and from 3ds max. 
The original scripts date back to 2011.

Installation proceeds by dragging and dropping or manually running the latest mzp file in 3ds max.
